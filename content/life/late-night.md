Hi 

So rn it is 2:18 am and I just came from gym 2.5 hours back,then did dinner and started into working and learning. As of now ,I am feeling quite focused rn after 1.5 hour of learning and it is actually good for me. So going through Tutorials revising Java ,Springboot and I feel it is  gonna be a long night but I am excited as really putting my head and making notes.

Just took a 20 min break and came here to write a blog.After pushig this ,might scroll twitter for couple of minutes & then back to work.

As one go through notes and tutorial ,you find certain concepts you didn't think about them in depth before or learnt and I came upon UTF-8 ,so curious looked  more up on UTF i.e Uninary Tranformation Format on chatgpt and went in depth there and just blowed away of the intricacies of it ,gonna write a technical post on it soon maybe by tomorrow let's see.

Also I haven't yet posted my workout pics yet updates ,so gonna do that too , I'll try to do my first fitness post today by dawn ..

But let's do couple of hour more work.

See ya....
