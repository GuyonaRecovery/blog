Hello , I am a normal guy residing in India turned 25 couple of weeks back.I have started this blog in the hope to get back on the path.
I don't drink ,smoke or do any kind of drugs .Total teetotaler kind of person .
But I have other demons /addictions which have resulted in making a mess in my life or let's just say took me out of my trajectory.

Things like anxiety, procrastination, overthinking, emotion overload, fear, watching adult explicit content, movies binge watching, daydreaming and some family problems etc have made me weak and made me stoop to new lows that I don't give a damn about my career ,work ,goals ,relationships etc.

So started this blog/journal to heal myself in 2024 as I take a note of my progress and keep a check in on timely basis.
Now I got into gym and  weight training few months back and trying to get into shape and build not just my physical but mainly my mental strength.Will be posting it's progress and to what i Have gained till now via photos,text etc.

Plus now will be actively journaling my coding work progress ,skill learning and as we go on... which was hampered during last couple of months.

Love and peace.
